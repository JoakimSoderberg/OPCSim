Sikn√§s-skylt Open Pixel Protocol Simulator
==========================================

This repository contains a **Simulator** for a real world digital LED-display that can be controlled via the [**Open Pixel Control Protocol**](http://openpixelcontrol.org/).

The simulator is a simple 3D program written in Unity that uses the same CAD model as the sign.

This repository can be a base if you want to do something similar.

This is closely related to the server project found here: https://github.com/JoakimSoderberg/siknas-skylt
